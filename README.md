## Introduction

#### What Are Crypto Duckies?
Crypto duckies is a project that has captured the hearts and minds of many crypto enthusiasts. 


#### Why Go Through All the Trouble?
The token was deployed as an ERC-1155 token under the OPENSEA TOKEN contract.
This repository comprises the efforts of the community in separating the Crypto Duckies community from the Opensea monolith. 

#### How Will It Work?
The token will follow similar steps towards immortality that were followed by Larvalabs and the Cryptopunks community.
